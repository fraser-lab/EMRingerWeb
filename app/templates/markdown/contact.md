#### EMRinger is under active development in the [Fraser Lab](http://fraserlab.com). Right now, the EMRinger software and web server are being worked on by [Ben Barad](http://fraserlab.com/members#Ben Barad). 

## Contributing
The web server is a flask app which is open source on github at [http://github.com/fraser-lab/emringer_web](http://github.com/fraser-lab/emringer_web) and the cctbx scripts for emringer are also available on github at [http://github.com/fraser-lab/emringer](http://github.com/fraser-lab/emringer). For bugs, please check out the issues on those respective pages.

If you have immediate questions, we are reachable by [email](mailto:benjamin.barad+emringer@gmail.com). 

## Special Thanks
Nathaniel Echols is the original author of the EMRinger scan algorithm in cctbx, and Kevin Hartman has been instrumental in the early development of the EMRinger webserver.
