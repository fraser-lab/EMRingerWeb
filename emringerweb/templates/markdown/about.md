# About EMRinger
------------

## Citing EMRinger
Barad BA, Echols N, Wang R, Cheng YC, Dimaio F, Adams P, Fraser JS. Side-chain directed density sampling in high-resolution cryoEM.

## The Ringer algorithm, adapted to electron microscopy
The ringer algorithm was originally developed by the Alber lab at UC Berkeley as a method of identifying alternative conformations in high resolution x-ray crystallography maps. Ringer iteratively samples the density at the atoms of a side chain as  dihedral angles 

## Who Develops EMRinger?
Ringer was developed by the Alber lab at UC Berkeley. 
EMRinger is under active development in the [Fraser lab at UCSF](http://fraserlab.com), with significant support from the [Phenix group at UC Berkeley](http://phenix-online.org).

## I found a bug, what do I do?
